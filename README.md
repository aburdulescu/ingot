ingot is a archiving tool written in Zig.

## Features

- Create and extract archives
- Strips metadata for reproducible/deterministic output
- Zero dependencies and cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, and Windows)

It's not a replacement for tar/zip, it's a specialized subset with focus on producing a deterministic archive.
